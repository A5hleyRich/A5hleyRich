### Hi there, I'm Ashley ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer based in the West Midlands, England. I work for [Delicious Brains](https://deliciousbrains.com/), building [SpinupWP](https://spinupwp.com/), and writing about [hosting WordPress](https://spinupwp.com/blog/). Before joining Delicious Brains, I served in the [Royal Air Force](https://www.raf.mod.uk/) as an ICT Technician.

I'm the founder of a [simple, privacy-focused comment system](https://getreplybox.com), called ReplyBox. And the co-founder of WP Content, a [community-curated WordPress news and articles](https://wpcontent.io) site.
